<!--project aim-->
<h2>Project Aim</h2>
<p>The goal of my first project is to create a professional and fresh website that helps people balance their mental wellbeing and productivity whilst working from home. I aim to competently use HTML and CSS to showcase clean code and detailed testing to produce a smooth flowing webpage.</p>

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<!--design wireframes-->
<h3>Design Wireframes</h3>
<p>Initially, to design the layout of Work from Home Guide, <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> was used to create different wireframes for Desktop, Tablet and Mobiles. Ultimately, the final deployed site ended up differentiating to the original wireframes in terms of colour scheme and minor structural components after feedback from others and personal change of opinion whilst building the webpage.</p>

<!--webpage structure-->
<h3>Webpage Structure</h3>
<p>Work from Home is a webpage the occupies only one page, with a navigation menu including four links that will take the user to the section of the webpage that they select. The Home section is the default page with the About, Your Space and Sign-Up section following consecutively. As the header is fixed the user always has the option to also select the main logo, title and sub-title of the webpage to refresh the entire page and be taken back to the initial home page. </p>

<!--reasons for design-->
<h3>Reasons for Design</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Fonts</h4>
<p>For consistency the chosen font I used was ****, with sans-serif as the fall-back font to be used if **** cannot be loaded by the browser. I gravitated towards **** as it is a font tha maintains a fresh, formal and professional look across the webpage but is still very inviting due to its’ slightly rounded edges. Across the webpage to create a dynamic feel I used a range of font-sizes, font-weights and alternated between a normal and oblique version of the font whilst still keeping it as ****.</p>
<h4>Colour Scheme</h4>
<p>The colour scheme chosen for the Work from Home Guide webpage is a balance of fresh and comforting. The main background colours of white and white-sage provide a fresh feel, with the black and maroon accent colours providing warmth and welcoming feelings. Combined, the colours perfectly corresponded with the desire overall feel of the webpage.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<!--features-->
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Work from Home Guide webpage is designed to be easy to navigate with clear, minimal and unintrusive amounts of information for the user in order to maintain the calm and relaxed feeling of the webpage. Each feature of the webpage is minimalistic and promotes a calm and relaxed reaction from the user. The familiar layout of the webpage supports this. </p>
<hr>
<h4>Main Titles and Navigation Menu</h4>
<ul>
<p>The main title, sub title, and logo are all located at the top of the webpage in the header on the left-hand side with the navigation menu occupying the right side of the header.</p>
<p>The header is fixed to the screen to avoid the user having to scroll back to the top of the page to refresh the page or to navigate through the different sections of the page. The decision against using the hamburger navigation menu and constantly using a standard navigation menu was to maintain the simplicity and the goal for minimum effort for the user.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Home</h4>
<ul>
<p>The home section is the first section the user will be presented with once the webpage is loaded, when refreshed and when the home navigation menu link is clicked.</p>
<p>The section is completely occupied by the main image of the site which is light, fresh and relevant, showing a woman sitting in professional wear in front of her laptop.  
More so, the main image includes cover text which enlarges as the page is loaded, with the main aim of the webpage encompassed in a single sentence ‘intertwining...’ to immediately inform the user on what to expect and the aim of the webpage.</p>

<!--project aim-->
## Project Aim
The goal of my first project is to create a visually professional and fresh website that helps people balance their mental wellbeing and productivity whilst working from home. I aim to competently use HTML and CSS to showcase clean code and detailed testing to produce a smooth flowing webpage.

### User Experience 

<!--design wireframes-->
## Design Wireframes
Initially, to design the layout of Work from Home Guide, Balsamiq was used to create different wireframes for Desktop, Tablet and Mobiles. Ultimately, the final deployed site ended up differentiating to the original wireframes in terms of colour scheme and minor structural components after feedback from others and personal change of opinion whilst building the webpage. Any changes made from the wireframe were to enhance the professional look of the webpage.

<!--webpage structure-->
## Webpage Structure
Work from Home is a webpage that occupies only one page, with a navigation menu including four links that will take the user to the section of the webpage that they select. The Home section is the default page with the About, Your Space and Sign-Up section following consecutively. As the header is fixed on desktop and tablet devices, the user always has the option to also select the main logo, title and sub-title of the webpage to refresh the entire page and be taken back to the initial home page. To enchance user experience the header is not fixed on mobiles and smaller screens to avoid the header taking up a large majority of the screen and becoming distractive.

<!--reasons for design-->
## Reasons for Design 
### Fonts 
- For consistency the main chosen font I decided to use was Libre Franklin, with sans-serif as the fall-back font to be used if Libre Franklin cannot be loaded by the browser. I gravitated towards Libre Franklin as it is a font tha maintains a fresh, formal and professional look across the webpage but is still very inviting due to its’ slightly rounded edges. 
- Across the webpage, to create a dynamic feel, I used a range of font-sizes, font-weights and alternated between a normal and oblique version of the font. 
- For the main heading, and section titles I decided to change the font to Merriweather Sans, with sans-serif as the fal-back font once again as it enhanced the professional look of the website and helped the section titles stand out.
### Colour Scheme 
- The colour scheme chosen for the Work from Home Guide webpage is a balance of fresh and comforting. The main background colours of white and white-sage provide a fresh feel, with the black and maroon accent colours providing warmth and a welcoming feel. 
- The maroon titles used aid to create consistency across the webpage as the user is clear that they have entered a new section of the webpage when seeing the maroon title. 
- More so, the use of black text effectively complimented the maroon. Combined, the colours perfectly corresponded with the desired overall feel of the webpage and enhanced user experience with the dark black and maroon colours standing out completely from the white and white-sage background colours used throughout the webpage.

<!--features-->
## Features
The Work from Home Guide webpage is designed to be easy to navigate with clear, minimal and unintrusive amounts of information for the user in order to maintain the calm and relaxed feeling of the webpage. Each feature of the webpage is minimalistic and promotes a calm and relaxed reaction from the user. The familiar layout of the webpage supports this.
### Main Titles and Navigation Menu 
* The main title, sub title, and logo are all located at the top of the webpage in the header on the left-hand side with the navigation menu occupying the right side of the header.
* The header is fixed to the screen to avoid the user having to scroll back to the top of the page to refresh the page or to navigate through the different sections of the page. When the user hovers over each navigation link it will be underlined to confirm to the user they are clicking the the correct section they wish to go to. The decision against using the hamburger navigation menu and constantly using a standard navigation menu was to maintain the simplicity and the goal for minimum effort for the user and maximum relaxation.
* The logo was inserted to add professionalism to the webpage, however is removed on smaller screens as it causes the header to become too cramped- going against the aim for a spacious and relaxed webpage.

### Home 
* The home section is the first section the user will be presented with once the webpage is loaded, when refreshed and when the home navigation menu link is clicked.
* The section is completely occupied by the main image of the site which is light, fresh and relevant, showing a woman sitting in professional wear in front of her laptop. The main images' colour scheme corresponds to the webpage and adds to the consistency of the webpage consequently.
* The main image includes cover text which enlarges as the page is loaded, with the main aim of the webpage encompassed in a single sentence ‘intertwining work and relaxation’ to immediately inform the user on what to expect and the aim of the webpage.
For smaller screens the cover text is removed as it causes the home portion of the webpage to look cramped.

![Home](assets/readme-images/collapsed%20home..png)
### About
* The About section of Work from Home Guide, also referred to as the Ethos section, is divided into 3 mini sections of information which essentially summarise the main aim of the webpage, the reasons for the webpage and how I aim to help the user reach this aim.
The About section provides clarity from the start of the webpage, promoting the feeling of calmness within the user.
* The About section includes an image of stacked pebbles on a blank and calm background to further add the feeling of serenity to the webpage.
![About](assets/readme-images/ethos%20image..png)
![About](assets/readme-images/collapsed%20ethos..png)
* The About section is followed by a brief image interval which includes a button that is able to take the user straight to the sign-up page to win a free candle. The image interval includes a calming image that fits the colour scheme of the webpage and is set to a fixed position to create a 3D effect when the user scrolls past the image. This is also to draw attention to the interval and the button that urges them to sign up to win a free candle.
![About](assets/readme-images/image%20interval%201%20image..png)
### Your Space 
* The Your Space Section begins with the Something To Listen To section which allows the user to select a YouTube video to listen to before they continue- with options including a Ted Talk, Lofi Hip-Hip video or a video of Nature Sounds.
* Under the sub-heading the Ted Talk, Lofi and Nature Sounds headings can be clicked and take you to each individual YouTube page if the user would prefer to select a different talk, lofi video or nature sounds video to listen to. The links not only open in a new tab but also open to the videos section of the youtube channels not the main channel page as the main channel page would auto-play a video where as the videos section of the channel pages will just provide the user with a range of videos that they can choose from. If the user does not wish to do this, the user can select one of the three videos presented with their short description and carry on to the next portion of the webpage.
* The three videos also become larger as you hover over them to alow for users to get a closer look at the videos and video descriptions.
* As screens reduce in size the videos fall under eachother.
On tablets and other medium sized screens the videos float either more to the left or the right so users scrolling wwith their hand will still be able to see the full size and descriptions of the videos without their hand getting in the way.
![Your Space](assets/readme-images/someething%20to%201%20image..png)
![Your Space](assets/readme-images/someething%20to%202%20image..png)
* Followed by this is the Get Ready portion of the Your Space section, which gives the user information on how they can get themselves and their space ready for the day in an effective way to ensure productivity and calm. This information is short and simple to prevent information overload.
* The Get Ready section of the webpage includes an image in the center which enlarges when hovered over to increase user experience- it demonstrates an example of a clean and fresh work desk that can be used as inspiration by the user when thinking of how they want to begin getting their space ready.
* On smaller screens the Get Ready section collapses into a string of vertical content and centers itself to avoid a cramped look.
![Your Space](assets/readme-images/get%20ready%20image..png)
![Your Space](assets/readme-images/collapsed%20get%20ready..png)
### Sign Up
* Above the Sign-Up section is another image interval that is identical to the one under the About section- enhancing the 3D effect of the webpage and consistency across the webpage.
![Sign Up](assets/readme-images/image%20interval%202%20image..png)
* The Sign-Up section is an opportunity for the user to enter in a draw to win a candle of their choice. It maintains the simple and fresh look of the webpage, and once submitted, presents the user with a pop up thanking them for entering the draw- upon closing this pop up the webpage will take the user back to the home section.
* The sign up form is centered in correspondence with the section headings and footer to maintain the consistency across the webpage and aligns with the colour scheme of the webpage too.
![Sign Up](assets/readme-images/sign%20up%20image..png)
![Sign Up](assets/readme-images/collapsed%20sign%20up..png)
### Footer 
* The footer is very simplistic, occupying a white background to match the header it simply includes three social media icons that are black to match the colour scheme and will take the user to each social media page which opens on a different tab.
* The icons in the footer turn maroon when hovered over to alert the user that they are about to select that particular icon if they choose to. Furthermore, the icons and footer text below are centered to correspond with the centered headings throughout the webpage and centered content.
* Under the social media tabs there is a brief line of text stated the webpage creator and copyright information for added professionalism.

 * For mobiles compressing the images will done done in the future if the webpage was to be used outside of educational purposes. Compressing the images would have saved loading time however as the images were added through css as background images this was not possible.
* In future webpages I shall also aim to use a facade for my youtube videos and passive listeners to further reduce loading time for users.

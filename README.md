<!--project aim-->
<h2>Project Aim</h2>
<p>The goal of my first project is to create a professional and fresh website that helps people balance their mental wellbeing and productivity whilst working from home. I aim to competently use HTML and CSS to showcase clean code and detailed testing to produce a smooth flowing webpage.</p>

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<!--design wireframes-->
<h3>Design Wireframes</h3>
<p>Initially, to design the layout of Work from Home Guide, <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> was used to create different wireframes for Desktop, Tablet and Mobiles. Ultimately, the final deployed site ended up differentiating to the original wireframes in terms of colour scheme and minor structural components after feedback from others and personal change of opinion whilst building the webpage.</p>
<hr>
<!--webpage structure-->
<h3>Webpage Structure</h3>
<p>Work from Home is a webpage the occupies only one page, with a navigation menu including four links that will take the user to the section of the webpage that they select. The Home section is the default page with the About, Your Space and Sign-Up section following consecutively. As the header is fixed the user always has the option to also select the main logo, title and sub-title of the webpage to refresh the entire page and be taken back to the initial home page. </p>
<hr>
<!--reasons for design-->
<h3>Reasons for Design</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Fonts</h4>
<li>For consistency the chosen font I used was ****, with sans-serif as the fall-back font to be used if **** cannot be loaded by the browser. I gravitated towards **** as it is a font tha maintains a fresh, formal and professional look across the webpage but is still very inviting due to its’ slightly rounded edges. Across the webpage to create a dynamic feel I used a range of font-sizes, font-weights and alternated between a normal and oblique version of the font whilst still keeping it as ****.</li>
<h4>Colour Scheme</h4>
<li>The colour scheme chosen for the Work from Home Guide webpage is a balance of fresh and comforting. The main background colours of white and white-sage provide a fresh feel, with the black and maroon accent colours providing warmth and welcoming feelings. Combined, the colours perfectly corresponded with the desire overall feel of the webpage.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<!--features-->
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Work from Home Guide webpage is designed to be easy to navigate with clear, minimal and unintrusive amounts of information for the user in order to maintain the calm and relaxed feeling of the webpage. Each feature of the webpage is minimalistic and promotes a calm and relaxed reaction from the user. The familiar layout of the webpage supports this. </p>
<hr>
<h4>Main Titles and Navigation Menu</h4>
<ul>
<li>The main title, sub title, and logo are all located at the top of the webpage in the header on the left-hand side with the navigation menu occupying the right side of the header.</li>
<li>The header is fixed to the screen to avoid the user having to scroll back to the top of the page to refresh the page or to navigate through the different sections of the page. The decision against using the hamburger navigation menu and constantly using a standard navigation menu was to maintain the simplicity and the goal for minimum effort for the user.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Home</h4>
<ul>
<li>The home section is the first section the user will be presented with once the webpage is loaded, when refreshed and when the home navigation menu link is clicked.</li>
<li>The section is completely occupied by the main image of the site which is light, fresh and relevant, showing a woman sitting in professional wear in front of her laptop.  
More so, the main image includes cover text which enlarges as the page is loaded, with the main aim of the webpage encompassed in a single sentence ‘intertwining...’ to immediately inform the user on what to expect and the aim of the webpage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>About</h4>
<ul>
<li>The About section of Work from Home Guide is divided into 3 mini sections of information which essentially summarise the main aim of the webpage, the reasons for the webpage and how I aim to help the user reach this aim.</li>
<li>The About section provides clarity from the start of the webpage, promoting the feeling of calmness within the user.</li>
<li>The About section is followed by a brief image interval which includes a button that is able to take the user straight to the sign-up page to win a free candle.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Your Space</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Your Space Section begins with the ‘Something...’ which allows the user to select a YouTube video to listen to before the continue- with options including a Ted Talk, Lofi Hip-Hip video or a video of Nature Sounds. Under the sub-heading the Ted Talk, Lofi and Nature Sounds headings can be clicked and take you to each individual YouTube page if the user would prefer to select a different talk, lofi video or nature sounds video to listen to. If not, the user can select one of the three videos presented with their short description and carry on to the next portion of the webpage.</li>
<li>Followed by this is the Get Ready portion of the Your Space section which gives the user information on how they can get themselves, their space, desk and work chair ready for the day in an effective way to ensure productivity and calm. This information is short and simple to prevent information overload.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sign Up</h4>
<ul>
<li>Above the Sign-Up section is another image interval that is identical to the one under the About section.</li>
<li>The Sign-Up section is an opportunity for the user to enter in a draw to win a candle of their choice. It maintains the simple and fresh look of the webpage and once submitted presents the user with a pop up thanking them for entering the draw- upon closing this pop up the webpage will take the user back to the home section.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Footer</h4>
<ul>
<li>The footer is very simplistic, occupying a white background to match the header it simply includes three social media icons that are black to match the colour scheme and will take the user to each social media page which opens on a different tab.</li>
<li>Under the social media tabs there is a brief line of text stated the webpage creator and copyright information.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<!--future features-->
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<!--candle section-->
<h4>Candle Section</h4>
<ul>
<li>A candle section will allow the user to shop for an array of candles once on the site to begin their self-care journey and journey in enhancing their work space at home.</li>
<li>This would be on a separate page within the webpage and would allow the user to sign-up for a candle subscription if they would prefer to do so.</li>
</ul>
<!--chat forum-->
<h4>Chat Forum</h4>
<ul>
<li>The chat forum would allow users working from home to chat about their day and engage in socialising to reduce feelings of loneliness.</li>
<li>This would be a monitored chat forum to avoid cyber abuse or offensive language.</li>
</ul>
<!--gallery-->
<h4>Gallery</h4>
<ul>
<li>The gallery would include inspiration pictures of different at home work set ups and you be located on a separate page within the webpage.</li>
</ul>
